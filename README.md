<h4>👩‍💻 Intern Details:</h4>

Name: Sejal Karnwal

Institute: Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology , Hisar

Duration: 4 Weeks (15th July 2025 to 7th August 2025)

AICTE ID: STU64548ff77b0d11683263479


<h4>📖 About the Internship:</h4>

This internship provided practical exposure to emerging technologies such as AI, Cloud, and Data Analytics using the IBM SkillsBuild and IBM Cloud platforms. The program was divided into weekly sessions including:
AI fundamentals, Cloud Computing, Data Analytics
Chatbot development and AutoAI usage
Real-world project development under expert mentorship
💡 Project: Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker


<h4>📌 Problem Statement</h4>

Users often struggle to understand the severity and cause of symptoms. Self-diagnosis using the internet can be misleading. There is a need for a trusted, AI-powered tool that provides symptom analysis and health advice based on credible data.


<h4>✅ Solution Overview</h4>

The project implements a conversational AI agent that:
Accepts symptoms via natural language input
Retrieves verified medical data from sources like WHO, NHP, and medical journals
Analyzes symptoms to suggest possible conditions, urgency levels, home remedies, and recommendations
Avoids self-diagnosis risks and supports multi-language interaction
Built and deployed using IBM Watsonx on IBM Cloud


<h4>⚙️ Technology Stack</h4>

Platform: IBM Cloud Lite
AI/NLP Engine: IBM Watsonx
Language Model: Mistral (open-weight LLM)
Frameworks: LangChain + LangGraph
Optional Libraries: ibm-watson, requests
Language: Python
Tools: GitHub, Postman


<h4>🚀 System Approach</h4>

Data Collection:
Medical data from WHO, NHP, Mistral model docs, verified journals

Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned, mapped symptom-condition relationships

Interface Design:
Conversational UI for symptom entry

Deployment:
Hosted using IBM Watsonx cloud-based services

Evaluation:
Feedback analysis, expert review cycles, multilingual support

<h4>📊 Output
Accepts user input like "I have sore throat and fever"

Returns possible conditions like Common Cold, Flu, etc.

Suggests urgency level: Low/Medium/High

Advises home remedies and when to consult a doctor

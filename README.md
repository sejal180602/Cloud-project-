Duration: 4 Weeks (15th July 2025 to 7th August 2025)

<h3>📖 About the Internship:</h3>
<p></p>This internship provided practical exposure to emerging technologies such as AI, Cloud, and Data Analytics using the IBM SkillsBuild and IBM Cloud platforms. The program was divided into weekly sessions including:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI fundamentals, Cloud Computing, Data Analytics</li>
<li>Chatbot development and AutoAI usage</li>
<li>Real-world project development under expert mentorship</li>
</ul>

<h3>💡 Project: Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker</h3>
<h4>📌 Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Users often struggle to understand the severity and cause of symptoms. Self-diagnosis using the internet can be misleading. There is a need for a trusted, AI-powered tool that provides symptom analysis and health advice based on credible data.</p>


<h3>✅ Solution Overview</h3>

The project implements a conversational AI agent that:
<ul>
<li>Accepts symptoms via natural language input</li>
<li>Retrieves verified medical data from sources like WHO, NHP, and medical journals</li>
<li>Analyzes symptoms to suggest possible conditions, urgency levels, home remedies, and recommendations</li>
<li>Avoids self-diagnosis risks and supports multi-language interaction</li>
<li>Built and deployed using IBM Watsonx on IBM Cloud</li>
</ul>

<h4>⚙️ Technology Stack</h4>

<b>Platform:</b> IBM Cloud Lite
<b>AI/NLP Engine:</b> IBM Watsonx
<b>Language Model:</b> Mistral (open-weight LLM)
<b>Frameworks:</b> LangChain + LangGraph
<b>Optional Libraries:</b> ibm-watson, requests
<b>Language:</b> Python
<b>Tools:</b> GitHub, Postman


<h4>🚀 System Approach</h4>

<h6>1.Data Collection:</h6>
Medical data from WHO, NHP, Mistral model docs, verified journals

<h6>2.Data Preprocessing:</h6>
Cleaned, mapped symptom-condition relationships

<h6>3.Interface Design:</h6>
Conversational UI for symptom entry

<h6>4.Deployment:</h6>
Hosted using IBM Watsonx cloud-based services

<h6>5.Evaluation:</h6>
Feedback analysis, expert review cycles, multilingual support

<h3>📊 Output</h3>
<ul>
<li>Accepts user input like "I have sore throat and fever"</li>
<li>Returns possible conditions like Common Cold, Flu, etc.</li>
<li>Suggests urgency level: Low/Medium/High.</li>
<li>Advises home remedies and when to consult a doctor.</li>
</ul>

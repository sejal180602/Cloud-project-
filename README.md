💡 Project: Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker
📌 Problem Statement
Users often struggle to understand the severity and cause of symptoms. Self-diagnosis using the internet can be misleading. There is a need for a trusted, AI-powered tool that provides symptom analysis and health advice based on credible data.
✅ Solution Overview
The project implements a conversational AI agent that:

Accepts symptoms via natural language input

Retrieves verified medical data from sources like WHO, NHP, and medical journals

Analyzes symptoms to suggest possible conditions, urgency levels, home remedies, and recommendations

Avoids self-diagnosis risks and supports multi-language interaction

Built and deployed using IBM Watsonx on IBM Cloud

⚙️ Technology Stack
Platform: IBM Cloud Lite

AI/NLP Engine: IBM Watsonx

Language Model: Mistral (open-weight LLM)

Frameworks: LangChain + LangGraph

Optional Libraries: ibm-watson, requests

Language: Python

Tools: GitHub, Postman

🚀 System Approach
Data Collection:
Medical data from WHO, NHP, Mistral model docs, verified journals

Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned, mapped symptom-condition relationships

Interface Design:
Conversational UI for symptom entry

Deployment:
Hosted using IBM Watsonx cloud-based services

Evaluation:
Feedback analysis, expert review cycles, multilingual support

📊 Output
Accepts user input like "I have sore throat and fever"

Returns possible conditions like Common Cold, Flu, etc.

Suggests urgency level: Low/Medium/High

Advises home remedies and when to consult a doctor
